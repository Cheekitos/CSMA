# Cheeki's Mods Archive v2
Current attempt at a Jekyll website that displays S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game mods. Main page shows a grid of mod cards, and each card now links to an individual mod page.

‚Üí [Current (Old) Page](https://www.cheeki.zone/)   

‚Üí [Check the New Page](https://cheekitos.github.io/CSMA/)

## üöß In Progress

- Fixing some quirks / display issues with the mod page template
- Writing each mod individual page (Short description, Long Description, Common troubleshooting steps, SEO stuff, making sure migration from old website didn't mess up things etc.

## ‚úÖ Done
- Rebuild old website to be Jekyll-based with Server-side rendering
- .md file template to build static pages. Easy update / maintain.
- Remove Download & Install guide links from the mod cards on the main page.
- Card Hovering zoom. Click the card anywhere to open the Mod Individual Page.
- Card has a short mod description, Individual page has a detailed description with pros and cons.
- Add new button for game engine (Anomaly, Call of Chernobyl etc..)
- Add Release Date
- Add common Troubleshooting & Tips section
- Links Subsections, Inline and extra formatting options
- Popup content into separate files, show/hide toggle buttons based on context

## ‚ùå To Do
- Add Requirements Section (Maybe, hard to find reliable info for most mods)
- Stop pushing my video reviews on the main page by replacing the embed with a mod custom thumbnail or screenshot
- Filtering options for search bar + keywords
- Screenshot gallery on mods individual pages
- Tailwind CLI and other optimizations

## üåü Wishlist
