# Cheeki's Mods Archive v2
Current attempt at a Jekyll website that displays S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game mods. Main page shows a grid of mod cards, and each card now links to an individual mod page.

‚Üí [Current (Old) Page](https://www.cheeki.zone/)   

‚Üí [Check the New Page](https://cheekitos.github.io/CSMA/)

## üöß In Progress
- Writing each mod individual page (Short description, Long Description, Pros & COns, Install Guide, Common troubleshooting steps, Screenshots, SEO...)

## ‚úÖ Done
- Rebuild old website to be Jekyll-based with Server-side rendering
- Use .md templates to build mod pages for easy, streamlined mod updates
- Remove Download & Install guide links from the mod cards on the main page
- Card Hovering zoom. Click the card anywhere to open the new Mod Individual Page
- Card has a short mod description, Individual page has a detailed description with pros and cons
- Add new button for game engine (Anomaly, Call of Chernobyl, OGSR etc..)
- Add Release Date
- Add common Troubleshooting & Tips section
- Links Subsections, Inline and extra formatting options
- First iteration of the Image Gallery & Lightbox
- Popup content into separate files, show/hide toggle buttons based on context
- Fixing some quirks / display issues with the mod page template
- Filtering system for the search bar (standalone, platform, low spec friendly)
- Adding A list view of all the mods (easy way to see the top 50 - worst 50)
- Adding 'Must Play' Option in the filters + highlight of the mod cards when selected
- Preview Image for the gallery Thumbnails for faster loading

## ‚ùå To Do
- Add Requirements Section (Maybe, hard to find reliable info for most mods)
- Stop pushing my video reviews on the main page, replace with screenshot or custom thumbnail
- Tailwind CLI and other optimizations

## üåü Wishlist 
- Open up the site to mods I didn't review, 3rd Party reviewers, collabs etc. 
- Move out of GitHub to dedicated hosting
- Users can create a profile and post reviews / grade mods
- Small discussion forum
